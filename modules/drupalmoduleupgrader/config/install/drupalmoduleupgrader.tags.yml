# This file defines the tags available to analyzers when creating issues.
# An issue can have any number of tags, and each tag consists of one or
# more arbitrary values. The tags don't affect the analyzers internally,
# but they can affect the output of the report generated by dmu-analyze
# so that developers can peruse their modules' issues in various ways.
#
# See hasTag(), getTag(), setTag(), and clearTag() in IssueInterface.

# Categories for issues. An issue can be in any number of categories.
# Categories are tagged by their machine name, so that the human-readable
# title is editable in one place (namely, here).
